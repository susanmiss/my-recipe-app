### About the Recipe App
- It's a CRUD application.


### What challenges I/we overcame
- Need to read the mongoose documentation to find the correct methods to use on backend
- I've lost a lot of time because I forgot to import axios in all components that I need to fetch.
- To update the recipe, didn't realise that need fetch to get the post before put. Took a while.

### What I/we struggled with
- Since I had difficult to unsderstand how to get id in uuid, used the slugify package to use the recipe title as id.
- Strugle to update in frontend the recipe.


### With more time
- Implement a better form to put the recipe
- Use uuid and not slug
- Implement images to each recipes
